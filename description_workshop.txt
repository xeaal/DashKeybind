This mod adds a dash keybind and disables it's initial double tap behaviour

The mod overwrites vanilla dash invokation system without imitating double tap, so this should work flawlessly. Sadly, this mod does not support Calamity items, but I'm looking forward to it

All of the source code is available here: https://github.com/xeaal/DashKeybind

Huge thanks to stormytuna#2688 for guiding me through almost the whole process and writing a detour for vanilla method!
