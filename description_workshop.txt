This mod adds a dash keybind and disables it's initial double tap behaviour, now with full Calamity support

The mod overwrites vanilla and Calamity Mod dash invokation system without imitating double tap, so this should work flawlessly. It also changes the logic of Omnidirectional dashes with God Slayer armor from Calamity Mod so that you can dodge without moving in direction you're facing at the moment. Not sure if that is useful, but I don't think that would cause any inconveniences. Omnidirectional dashes still use hotkey provided for it by Calamity

Huge thanks to https://steamcommunity.com/id/stormytuna for guiding me through almost the whole process and writing a detour for vanilla method

Also huge thanks to https://steamcommunity.com/id/Steviegt6/ also known as Tomat for a lot of help with detouring dash system of Calamity, literally rewriting parts of the code and to "basically, i am little cat#5356" for exceptional help in making the mod work
