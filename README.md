# DashKeybind
This mod adds a dash keybind and disables it's initial double tap behaviour, now with Calamity support!

The mod overwrites vanilla and Calamity Mod horizontal dash invokation system without imitating double tap, so this should work flawlessly.

All of the source code is available here: https://github.com/xeaal/DashKeybind

Huge thanks to https://steamcommunity.com/id/stormytuna for guiding me through almost the whole process and writing a detour for vanilla method!

Also huge thanks to https://steamcommunity.com/id/Steviegt6/ also known as Tomat for a lot of help of detouring dash system of Calamity, literally rewriting parts of the code and to "basically, i am little cat#5356" for exceptional help in making the mod work!
