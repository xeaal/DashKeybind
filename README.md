# DashKeybind
This mod adds a dash keybind and disables it's initial double tap behaviour!

The mod overwrites vanilla dash invokation system without imitating double tap, so this should work perfectly. Sadly, this mod does not support Calamity items, but I'm looking forward to it.

Huge thanks to stormytuna#2688 for guiding me through almost the whole process and writing a detour for vanilla method!
